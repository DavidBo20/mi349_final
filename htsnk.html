                <h1>The Heatsink</h1>
                <p>A heatsink is a component used to dissipate heat away from a computerâ€™s parts, such as the CPU or GPU. It works by absorbing the heat generated by the component and spreading it over a larger surface area, allowing it to cool more efficiently. Typically made of metal (like aluminum or copper), heatsinks often have fins or ridges to increase surface area and are paired with fans to enhance cooling. This helps prevent overheating and ensures the component operates at optimal temperatures.

                <h2>What does the heatsink do?</h2>
                <p>A heatsink helps cool down computer components by absorbing and dissipating the heat they generate. It spreads the heat over a larger surface area, often with fins or ridges to increase airflow, and may work with a fan to improve cooling. This prevents overheating and ensures stable performance. </p>
                <h2>What is the price range?</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>1. Entry-level heatsinks: $10 to $30 (basic cooling solutions with aluminum construction, suitable for low-power CPUs or non-intensive tasks).</li>
                <li>2. Mid-range heatsinks: $30 to $60 (offers better materials like copper heat pipes and improved cooling performance, ideal for gaming or moderate workloads).</li>
                <li>3. High-end heatsinks: $60 to $100 (larger designs with advanced cooling technologies, suitable for overclocked CPUs or high-performance systems).</li>
                <li>4. Premium heatsinks: $100 and above (top-tier cooling solutions with exceptional build quality, advanced heat dissipation features, and support for extreme performance or silent operation).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>*These prices can fluctuate based on brand, specifications, and market demand.</p>
