                <h1>The RAM</h1>
                <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of temporary storage that stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly while performing tasks. It allows for faster read and write operations compared to storage devices like hard drives or SSDs. RAM is volatile, meaning its data is lost when the computer is turned off. More RAM helps improve a computerâ€™s multitasking ability and overall performance, particularly in memory-intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, and running multiple applications. 
                </p>
                <h2>What does the RAM do?</h2>
                <p>RAM temporarily stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly while running programs. It allows the computer to perform tasks efficiently by providing fast, short-term storage for active processes and applications. More RAM enables smoother multitasking and faster performance in memory-intensive tasks. </p>
                <h2>What is the price range?</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>1. Entry-level RAM: $20 to $50 (suitable for basic tasks like web browsing, office applications, and light multitasking with lower memory capacities, typically 4GB to 8GB).</li>
                <li>2. Mid-range RAM: $50 to $100 (ideal for gaming and general productivity, offering better speeds, more capacity (8GB to 16GB), and improved reliability).</li>
                <li>3. High-end RAM: $100 to $200 (designed for performance enthusiasts and gamers, offering faster speeds, higher capacities (16GB to 32GB), and additional features like RGB lighting).</li>
                <li>4. Premium RAM: $200 and above (top-tier memory with extreme speeds, larger capacities (32GB+), and specialized features for overclocking or high-performance computing).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>*These prices can fluctuate based on brand, specifications, and market demand.</p>
