                <h1>The Fans</h1>
                <p>PC fans are cooling devices that help regulate the temperature of a computer's components by promoting airflow inside the case. They draw in cool air from the outside and expel hot air generated by parts like the CPU, GPU, and power supply. Fans prevent overheating, ensuring stable performance and longevity of components. They come in various sizes, speeds, and designs, often with options for customizing airflow or adding RGB lighting for aesthetics. 
                </p>
                <h2>What does the fan do?</h2>
                <p>Fans help cool down a computer by moving air through the case. They draw in cool air and push out hot air to maintain optimal temperatures for components like the CPU, GPU, and power supply. This airflow prevents overheating, ensuring the system runs smoothly and efficiently. </p>
                <h2>What is the price range?</h2>
                <ol>1. Entry-level PC fans: $15 to $30 (basic fans for general airflow, typically offering standard cooling without advanced features or noise reduction).</ol>
                <ol>2. Mid-range PC fans: $30 to $50 (improved airflow, quieter operation, and often with additional features like customizable lighting or RGB options).</ol>
                <ol>3. High-end PC fans: $50 to $75 (designed for high-performance cooling with better airflow, noise reduction, and enhanced build quality, often used in gaming or overclocked systems).</ol>
                <ol>4. Premium PC fans: $75+ and above (top-tier fans offering advanced features like ultra-quiet operation, customizable RGB lighting, and extreme airflow for high-end builds or cooling solutions).</ol>
                <p>*These prices can fluctuate based on brand, specifications, and market demand.</p>
