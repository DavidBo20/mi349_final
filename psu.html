                <h1>The Power Supply</h1>
                <p>A PSU (Power Supply Unit) is a component that converts electrical power from an outlet into a stable, usable form for the computerâ€™s components. It provides power to the motherboard, CPU, GPU, storage devices, and other peripherals. The PSU ensures that the system gets the right amount of voltage and current for optimal performance, and it often includes protection features like overcurrent and overheating safeguards. 
                </p>
                <h2>What does the PSU do?</h2>
                <p>A power supply unit (PSU) converts electricity from an outlet into the appropriate voltage and current needed to power a computer's components. It distributes energy to parts like the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and storage, ensuring stable and reliable operation. The PSU also includes protections against electrical issues like surges or overheating. </p>
                <h2>What is the price range?</h2>
                <ol>1. Entry-level power supplies: $30 to $60 (suitable for budget systems with basic power needs and lower wattage, typically under 500W).</ol>
                <ol>2. Mid-range power supplies: $60 to $120 (offers better efficiency, higher wattage (500W to 750W), and reliable performance for gaming and general-purpose builds).</ol>
                <ol>3. High-end power supplies: $120 to $200 (designed for higher wattages (750W to 1000W+), modular cables, and better efficiency ratings, ideal for performance or multi-GPU setups).</ol>
                <ol>4. Enthusiast power supplies: $200 and above (premium features like fully modular cables, ultra-high efficiency ratings (80 Plus Platinum or Titanium), and support for extreme power demands in high-end builds).</ol>
                <p>*These prices can fluctuate based on brand, specifications, and market demand.</p>
