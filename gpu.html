                <h1>The GPU</h1>
                <p>A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized processor designed to handle and accelerate the rendering of images, videos, and 3D graphics. It offloads these tasks from the CPU, making it essential for gaming, video editing, 3D modeling, and other graphically intensive applications. Modern GPUs also support tasks like AI processing and data analysis, thanks to their high parallel computing power. They can be integrated into the CPU or exist as dedicated graphics cards. 
                </p>
                <h2>What does the GPU do?</h2>
                <p>The GPU processes and renders images, videos, and graphics for display. It excels at handling complex visual tasks by performing many calculations simultaneously, making it essential for gaming, 3D modeling, video editing, and AI workloads. The GPU works alongside the CPU to ensure smooth visuals and efficient graphical performance. </p>
                <h2>What is the price range?</h2>
                <ol>1. Entry-level GPUs: $100 to $250 (suitable for light gaming, 1080p resolution, and basic tasks like video playback and photo editing).</ol>
                <ol>2. Mid-range GPUs: $250 to $500 (ideal for 1080p to 1440p gaming, moderate content creation, and solid performance in modern games).</ol>
                <ol>3. High-end GPUs: $500 to $1,000 (designed for 1440p to 4K gaming, professional video editing, and advanced 3D rendering).</ol>
                <ol>4. Enthusiast GPUs: $1,000 and above (top-tier performance for 4K or higher resolutions, ray tracing, AI workloads, and professional applications).</ol>
                <p>*These prices can fluctuate based on brand, specifications, and market demand.</p>
