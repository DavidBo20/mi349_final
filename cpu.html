                <h1>The CPU</h1>
                <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the brain of a computer. It executes instructions from programs by performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations specified by the instructions. Composed of millions or even billions of tiny transistors, the CPU processes data at incredibly high speeds, typically measured in gigahertz (GHz). It operates by fetching instructions from memory, decoding them to understand what actions to take, and then executing those actions. Modern CPUs often have multiple cores, allowing them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which enhances overall performance and efficiency in computing tasks. 
                </p>
                <h2>What does the CPU do?</h2>
                <p>The CPU performs calculations, processes data, and executes instructions from programs. The CPU takes input, processes it according to the instructions in software, and delivers the output. It manages essential tasks like arithmetic operations, logical comparisons, and decision-making while coordinating with other components like memory and storage to ensure smooth system operation.</p>
                <h2>What is the price range?</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>1. Entry-level CPUs: $50 to $150 (suitable for basic tasks like web browsing and document editing).</li>
                <li>2. Mid-range CPUs: $150 to $350 (good for gaming, content creation, and multitasking).</li>
                <li>3. High-end CPUs: $350 to $700 (ideal for demanding applications, gaming, and professional workloads).</li>
                <li>4. Enthusiast and workstation CPUs: $700+ (designed for heavy-duty tasks like 3D rendering, video editing, and data analysis).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>*These prices can fluctuate based on brand, specifications, and market demand.</p>
