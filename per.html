                <h1>Peripherals</h1>
                <p>
                    Peripherals are external devices that connect to a computer to enhance its functionality. They include input devices like keyboards, mice, and controllers, as well as output devices like monitors, printers, and speakers. Peripherals also include storage devices (e.g., external hard drives) and accessories such as webcams, headphones, and gaming devices. These devices allow users to interact with the computer and expand its capabilities for various tasks. 
                </p>
                <h2>What do peripherals do?</h2>
                <p>Peripherals enhance a computer's functionality by enabling input, output, and additional capabilities. Input peripherals like keyboards and mice let users interact with the system, while output peripherals like monitors and printers display or produce results. Other peripherals, such as external storage, webcams, or gaming controllers, expand the computerâ€™s usability for tasks like data storage, communication, or entertainment. </p>
                <h2>What is the price range?</h2>
                <p>Price range can vary between items required. Depending on what is needed for the setup, more or less can be spent on different items. There is no single price range because of the variety of items that can be purchased</p>
